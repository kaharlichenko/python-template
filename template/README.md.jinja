## Installation

To build this project, you only need to install **mise**:

- **mise**: Tool version manager. Install from [mise.jd.dev](https://mise.jd.dev/)

Once mise is installed, run:

```bash
mise install
```

This will automatically install the correct Python version (from `.python-version`) and uv (from `mise.toml`). No additional manual installation is required.

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run:

```bash
docker build -t {{ project_name_kebab_case }}:latest .
```

**Note for SELinux systems**: The build process uses bind mounts. On SELinux-enabled systems, you must disable labeling during the build:

```bash
docker build --security-opt label=disable -t {{ project_name_kebab_case }}:latest .
```
